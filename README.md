The project wraps [SwiftyOpenCC](https://github.com/ddddxxx/SwiftyOpenCC) by
[ddddxxx](https://github.com/ddddxxx) into a [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)
spec. You can use Swift Package Manager or Carthage to install SwiftyOpenCC,
however, it does not provide a CocoaPods spec, and I want to make my own life
easier.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the
Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

OpenCC is available through CocoaPods. To install it, simply add the following
line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'OpenCC', :git => 'https://github.com/zonble/OpenCC.git', :submodules => true
```
